# COMP30026 - Models of Computation

Self-created resources for **COMP30026 - Models of Computation** such as tutorial solutions, Haskell solutions for tutorial problems and just practices for certain things.

Haskell code may or may not work entirely. For obvious reasons, I will not push any assessible code here.

## Tex + Markdown

GitHub does not allow LaTeX equation to be embedded in Markdown. Fortunately, my editor does... since that is the case you might need to down load an editor that allows you to do such a thing, such as:

- Typora
- Visual Studio Code (w/ Markdown Editor Support)
