# COMP30026: Context-Free Grammars

A *grammar* is a **set of substitution rules**. 

For a grammar $G$, we can use the following notation:

- $L(G)$: The *language* of the grammar $G$.
- Any language that can be generated by some context-free grammar is called a *context-free language*.

Note that the set of all regular languages **is a subset of** the all context-free languages.
