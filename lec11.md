# Models of Computations: Sets

A set is a collection, we denote membership as:
- Membership: $a \in A$.

Complete specifications:
- $S = \{1,2,3\}$, $T = \{a,b,c,d\}$
- Order and repetition are irrelevant in defining sets.

For a large set, we can define them based on an abstraction. Suppose that $P: x \mapsto \{\mathbf{t,f}\}$, then the notation:

$$
S = \{x \ | \ P(x)\}
$$
denotes "the set of all things from x" where $P(x)$ evaluates to true.
